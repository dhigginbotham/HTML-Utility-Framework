HTML-Utility-Framework
======================

HTML &amp; CSS Utility Framework

I created this to help me offset the insane amounts of Website templates I have been working on. Free to use for whomever, I claim no ownership of the components added.

Some Responsive fun in there... More to come soon.

Version 1
=========

Tipsy Added for popups - http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/ - props
IcoMoon Icons Added for easy, hot sex - http://keyamoon.com/icomoon/ - props, I love this tool.
